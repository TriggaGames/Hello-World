Creating virtual environments - helpful for keeping packages specific to your project
	1. python -m venv your-venv-name
	2. your-venv-name\Scripts\activate # to activate your virtual environment, run this
	3. NOTE: Always check that the interpreter is your environment
		Go to: ctrl+shift+P -> Python: Select interpreter\Enter interpreter path
		Navigate from here and look for your virtual environment. 
		By selecting your environment, the interpreter will be your venv.

NOTE: If you pip install anything in a specific project that has a venv, that package will not be installed onto any other projects. You must create a new venv for each project you do.

NOTE: Most of my virtual environments will be named after me (JC_venv)
